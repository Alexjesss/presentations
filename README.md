# The order of the Watch
## Rules
* 10 to 15 minutes of talking
* 5 minutes of Q/A and feedback
* Can be about anything, but preferably tech related


The watch is a moment of 10 to 15 minutes, each day after the break, where the junior gives a presentation or live code demo about anything tech related.
Possible subjects are Tech news, programming languages, how to manage a server, ...

When in doubt if something is suitable for the Watch, feel free to ask your coach.

Important to note is that you are not required to use a powerpoint, you can be creative and use different ways of enhancing your watch (making a game, using a quiz). Just be prepared for the question of the coach why you choose this way of presentation.

### Always be prepared for the next 3 watches.
### This means that if you have a watch on Wednesday, you should be able to give your talk on Monday.
**If you are in class but are not prepared, you will have to give an extra watch!**

### the arrow `-->` means that person is the next one to present! A checked box means you can relax for a short while :D
